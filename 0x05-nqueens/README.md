# 0x05. N Queens

The “0x05. N Queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. This project involves understanding several key concepts and using resources to grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

## Background Context

The N Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. This project tests your ability to implement backtracking algorithms and understand recursive problem-solving techniques.

## Concepts Needed

### Backtracking Algorithms

Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

- [Backtracking Introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)

### Recursion

Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.

- [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

### List Manipulations in Python

Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.

- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Python Command Line Arguments

Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module.

- [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N Queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
