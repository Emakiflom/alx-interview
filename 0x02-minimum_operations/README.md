## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- How to create tables with constraints
- How to optimize queries by adding indexes
- What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
- What is and how to implement views in MySQL
- What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Concepts Needed
### Dynamic Programming
Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.

### Prime Factorization
Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.

### Code Optimization
Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.

### Greedy Algorithms
The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.

### Basic Python Programming
Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
