# 0x09. Island Perimeter

## Overview

In this project, you will solve the "Island Perimeter" problem using a 2D grid representation. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D list of integers. The challenge involves applying your understanding of 2D arrays, iterating through matrices, and using conditional logic to determine the contribution of each land cell to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Learn how to navigate and manipulate 2D arrays (matrices) in Python.
- Understand how to implement conditional logic to determine cell properties within a grid.
- Develop an algorithm to efficiently calculate the perimeter of an island in a 2D grid.
- Practice writing efficient Python code that adheres to the PEP 8 style guide.

## Requirements

- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Operating system:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python version:** 3.4.3
- **PEP 8 style:** Your code should conform to PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7).
- **README:** A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- **Executable:** All files must be executable.
- **First line:** The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Modules and Functions:** All modules and functions must be documented.

## Project Task

### Task 0: Island Perimeter

**Objective:** Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that calculates the perimeter of the island described in the `grid`.

**Parameters:**

- `grid` is a list of list of integers:
  - `0` represents water.
  - `1` represents land.
  - Each cell is square with a side length of 1.
  - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
  - The grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100.
  - The grid is completely surrounded by water.
  - There is only one island (or nothing).
  - The island does not contain "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water surrounding the island).

**Return:**

- The function should return an integer representing the perimeter of the island.

**Example:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
island_perimeter = __import__('0-island_perimeter').island_perimeter

if __name__ == "__main__":
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output: 12
