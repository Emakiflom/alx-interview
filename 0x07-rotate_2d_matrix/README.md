# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Overview

In this project, you will implement an algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. The challenge is to perform this rotation in-place, meaning you should modify the matrix without using any extra space for another matrix. This problem tests your understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and manipulate 2D matrices in Python.
- Perform in-place operations on data structures to minimize space complexity.
- Implement matrix transposition and row reversal as steps in matrix rotation.
- Use nested loops effectively to iterate through and modify 2D matrices.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Matrix Representation in Python
- A 2D matrix in Python can be represented as a list of lists. For example:
  ```python
  matrix = [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
  ]
